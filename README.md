# Project Manager

Project Manager is a simple app that can be used to organize a project into tasks and assign tasks to individual users to address.

## Install

To install this app, clone the repository. Then, navigate to its directory in your command line and run

```
$ bundle install
```

After that, the app should be useable outside of the ability to connect through Github, which naturally requires a secret.
